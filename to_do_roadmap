synchronization and communication library
for read and write
we will go with the givens rotation method as the paper presents that as the fastest
also maybe we can find some references for the same.
givens rotation method
compute r^2 = a^2 + b^2
and c = a/r and s = b/r

questions - 
1. +one implimentation means more core should be included or totally different implimentation
with the same or different method?
2. is the R matrix enough as the output? we dont want to give a q matrix?
3. is the 16 point accuracy required

Theory
givens rotation is applying a set of rotations on the matrix,  ie multiplying the matrix with G1, G2, etc to get R
